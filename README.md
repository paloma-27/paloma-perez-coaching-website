### Steps to Set Up
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage
The website features multiple sections covering:
- Information about services offered.
- A hero section with a call-to-action.
- A stats section that showcases expertise.
- A contact form to request free consultations.

Navigate through the site and fill out the contact form to inquire about services.

## Features
- Responsive design optimized for all devices.
- Smooth scrolling navigation.
- Interactive contact form with basic validation.
- Tailwind CSS and custom animations for an appealing UI.
- Insightful sections detailing the services and background of Paloma J. Pérez.

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following dependencies:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
  
No backend dependencies are present, as this is a front-end-driven project.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```
/project-root
|-- index.html         # Main HTML file
|-- style.css          # Custom CSS file for additional styling
|-- script.js          # JavaScript file for handling interactivity and form submission
```

### Additional Notes
- The website is designed with accessibility in mind, utilizing semantic HTML elements.
- The contact form simulates submission success without a backend; consider implementing an actual backend for functional submissions.
- It is recommended to customize the `<repository-url>` and `<project-directory>` placeholders in the installation instructions with the actual values for your use.
